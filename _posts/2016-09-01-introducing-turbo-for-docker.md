Minasan, kon'nichiwa (Japense)(In English - Hello Friends). Hope you folks are having an awesome day at work ! For the past sometime I have been learning and exploring golang.It is an awesome language becoming popular like python and java.Following the reason to implement golang in some of my project's.I started to implement golang and try golang in the most efficient manner as possible.This year I decided to start this project following my process of learning.As much like as every developer I Hope you find them useful and worth contributing.


## Turbo

One of the most popular container projects in the market is [Docker][1].It has been in the market for very less no. of years.But has gained popularity like nothing else in the market.Since the introduction of [Docker][1] project containers have been continously gaining momentum and recognition than before.With time the current methodologies to build containers have been changing and replacing with time.

[Turbo][2] is a simple yet powerfull utility for [Docker][1].The main aim for designing [turbo][2] main focus is to introduce simplicity,automate the current process to build a flexible enviorment and to make [docker][1]  usage like never before.[Turbo][2] implements simple and regularly used useful commands on a currently installed [docker][1] enviorment.It is written in [golang][6].This makes it more compatible with [docker][1].It is lightweight in nature which makes it awesome to use and can be deployed wherever you want.

## Why Turbo ?

The real answer to this question is curiosity.I think as a regular docker user myself I wanted to experience some new tools and functionalities with docker.Although I agree,that docker has a beautiful cli that provides almost everything you need to play with containers.But, I guess having everything is never enough.Haha.So I began enjoying adding more options that makes it easy to use and adopt docker in a more useful and interactive manner.Although the journey has just begun.There's a lot to be done.
